# Finger Counting Classification

## Project: Classification II | Foundations of Modern Machine Learning Project

This mini-project tackles the computer vision task of identifying the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using fundamental and basic Machine Learning algorithms. The primary goal is to explain and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This repository is part of the course offered by iHub, IIIT Hyderabad: Foundations of Modern Machine Learning.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Decision Tree Learning**
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
3. **Random Forests**

## Observations

After applying the three methods - Decision Tree Learning, SVM, and Random Forests - it can be observed that Random Forests offer the highest accuracy for this task.

## Introduction

Finger counting is a fundamental task in computer vision with various applications, including gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and sign language interpretation. This project aims to classify the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using basic machine learning algorithms. By comparing the performance of Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forests, we gain insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages.
