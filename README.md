# Finger Counting Classification

## Project: Classification II | Foundations of Modern Machine Learning Project

This mini-project tackles the computer vision task of identifying the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using fundamental and basic Machine Learning algorithms. The primary goal is to explain and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This repository is part of the course offered by iHub, IIIT Hyderabad: Foundations of Modern Machine Learning.

## Algorithms Used

## Introduction

Finger counting is a fundamental task in computer vision with various applications, including gesture recognition, human-computer interaction, and sign language interpretation. This project aims to classify the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using basic machine learning algorithms. By comparing the performance of Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forests, we gain insights into their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finger-counting-classification.git
cd finger-counting-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run all the cells in the notebook in the given order

## Results

The following table summarizes the accuracy of each algorithm:

| Algorithm         | Accuracy (%) |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree     | 95.16       |
| SVM               | 95.74       |
| Random Forests    | 98.29        |

Based on the results, Random Forests provide the highest accuracy for finger counting classification.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored three fundamental machine learning algorithms for the task of finger counting in computer vision. Our experiments showed that Random Forests outperform Decision Trees and SVM in terms of accuracy. This highlights the robustness and effectiveness of ensemble methods for classification tasks.
